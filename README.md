![BlueSky Module Report](BlueSky_module.png)

Reports on BlueSky installs and shows some optional advanced security info.
(see: https://github.com/BlueSkyTools/BlueSkyConnect)

Retrieves information from the preferences file /var/bluesky/preference.plist.
And checks for VNC LocalHost Only and Password Authentication settings.
Setting up VNC Localhost Only would be more secure,
as would turning off Password Authentication in favour of SSH Keys.
The techniques for these methods were provided by Stefan Oberle in the BlueSky Connect Wiki.

The following information is stored in the table:

* version - The BlueSky version
* VNC Localhost only (you may enable this feature to increase security - see the Wiki)
* Password Authentication (you may turn this off when using SSH keys for added security - see the Wiki)


## Notes

An output file is only created if the preferences file exists in the /var/bluesky folder.
The output file is removed if the preferences file no longer exists so that new records will not be created.
